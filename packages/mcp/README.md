## Why this exists

You are writing code in Cursor / Claude Code / Windsurf. Your AI just added an endpoint that reads a query param, interpolates it into a SQL string, and returns the result. You know it's a SQL-injection surface. Your AI doesn't — and even if it "knows", it has no way to *do* something about it beyond suggesting you add validation.

With `@jikida/mcp` connected, the same AI can now:
- **Scan the endpoint** you just wrote for real vulnerabilities (via `scan_domain`)
- **Check security headers** on the site it deploys to (`check_headers`)
- **See attacks that already hit** the same route on other environments (`list_recent_attacks`)
- **Guard the code** you just wrote for SQL concat, hardcoded secrets, missing auth (`guard_code`)
- **Add a WAF rule or block an IP/ASN** in production, with explicit confirmation (`add_waf_rule`, `block_ip` — Pro+)
- **Explain in plain English** what a WAF verdict means and how to reproduce it (`explain_verdict`)

The MCP server calls no LLM of its own — it runs on **your** AI assistant's credits and enforces your per-site plan quotas (over quota returns a `429` with an `upgrade_url`).

No context switch. No dashboard tab. No "please go check X on jikida.io". The AI stays in your editor and does the work.

## Quick install

```bash
# Global (recommended for daily use)
npm install -g @jikida/mcp

# Or per-project via npx
npx -y @jikida/mcp
```

**Connect your account** — one-line device-code link. Opens your browser, waits for approval, stores the token at `~/.jikida/config.json`:

```bash
jikida link
```

Or set `JIKIDA_TOKEN=df_live_...` in your environment. Either works. Get a token at [app.jikida.io/developer](https://app.jikida.io/developer).

## Wire it into your assistant

### Claude Code

Add to `~/.claude/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jikida": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@jikida/mcp"],
      "env": { "JIKIDA_TOKEN": "df_live_..." }
    }
  }
}
```

Reload Claude Code. The `jikida` tools appear in the tools list.

### Cursor

Add to `~/.cursor/mcp.json` — same JSON block as Claude Code.

### Windsurf

`~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json` — same JSON block.

### VS Code (Copilot Chat)

Command palette → *MCP: Add Server* → paste the block. Or edit `~/.vscode/mcp.json` directly.

### Any other stdio-MCP client

`@jikida/mcp` is a plain stdio server. Any transport that speaks MCP works.

## Tools exposed

| Tool | Free | Pro | Max | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `scan_domain` | ✅ 10/mo | ✅ 100/mo | ✅ ∞ | Pentest scan of any public URL. Returns grade A-F + failing checks — headers, TLS, cookies, exposed `.env`/`.git`, **email security (SPF / DKIM / DMARC)**, and compliance-style findings. On an **onboarded Max/Agency site** it runs the **deep environment pentest** — active probes against your live infra (version-CVE fingerprint, subdomain-takeover, expanded exposure pack, GraphQL introspection, reflected-origin CORS, open-redirect, reflected-XSS) on top of the surface scan. |
| `check_headers` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | TLS grade, HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy in one call. |
| `list_sites` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Every site under your account with plan + last-scan + coverage status. |
| `list_monitors` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Every uptime monitor + latest status + last-checked timestamp. |
| `list_recent_attacks` | ✅ 7d | ✅ 30d | ✅ 90d | Recent WAF + honeypot events from the last N hours (rule, IP, path, action). |
| `list_recent_scans` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Your recent pentest + repo/vibe scans, with target, grade, and pass/warn/fail counts — including the email-security and compliance sections. |
| `explain_verdict` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Plain-English explanation of a WAF verdict or rule: what it catches, how attackers use it, how to reproduce, how to mitigate. |
| `add_waf_rule` | ❌ | ✅ 25 rules | ✅ ∞ | Add a custom WAF rule (pattern, target, action) to a site you own. Requires explicit confirmation. |
| `block_ip` | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | Block a specific IP or ASN across sites you own. Requires explicit confirmation. |
| `run_vibe_scan` | ❌ | ✅ 20/mo | ✅ ∞ | Vibe-coder scan of a public URL: exposed secrets, open S3 buckets, Supabase RLS off, wide-open Firebase rules. |
| `scan_repo` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Bring-your-own-repo SAST + secrets scan of a public `github.com/{org}/{repo}`. Probes the default branch for `.env`, `firebase-adminsdk*.json`, `serviceAccountKey.json` and 13 secret-family patterns; cross-references pinned deps against OSV (known CVEs); flags **dead/unused dependencies** and **inert MCP config**, typosquatted/hallucinated packages, insecure Dockerfiles, and CI-workflow secret leaks. High-signal **dangerous-sink** detection catches the AI-slop patterns a linter waves through: `eval()`/shell-exec on request data, disabled TLS verification, wide-open CORS, debug mode left on, unsafe deserialization (`pickle.loads`/`unserialize`/`yaml.load`), and raw-HTML XSS sinks. Static only — never runs the repo. |
| `guard_code` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Reactive SAST on a code snippet. Catches hardcoded secrets (Stripe/GitHub/GitLab/Slack tokens, AWS `AKIA` keys, Google `AIza` keys, PEM private keys), SQL string concat, missing input validation, missing rate limits on auth, client-side authorization, prompt injection, wildcard permissions, open CORS, **disabled TLS verification**, **unsafe deserialization**, dynamic eval, and XSS sinks. Run after every security-sensitive edit. |
| `check_s3_bucket` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Probe a public S3 bucket for world-readable / world-listable access. Returns a grade + the HEAD/LIST status. |
| `get_security_preferences` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Read the user's saved cross-session preferences (e.g. `never_scan_production_without_ask`, `always_block_env_probes`). |
| `set_security_preference` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Save a preference the user asked the AI to remember across sessions. |
| `list_cves` | ✅ 100/day | ✅ 100/day | ✅ 100/day | Look up known CVEs affecting a package via osv.dev. Supports npm, PyPI, Packagist, Go, RubyGems, crates.io, Maven, NuGet. |
| `pentest_status` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Status of a pentest run (or the most recent one). Useful for polling while a long scan runs. |

All read tools are always safe. Write tools (`add_waf_rule`, `block_ip`, `set_security_preference`) require explicit user approval — every MCP-compatible client shows an approval dialog before running them, and the server never auto-applies changes. Write tools are also plan-gated: the server returns a `429` with an `upgrade_url` when the token's plan doesn't cover the tool.

## How the AI actually uses these tools

The MCP server exposes each tool with a rich JSON schema that includes:
- The exact parameters the tool needs (with descriptions the AI can read)
- Examples of expected input
- What the return value looks like

Because MCP is a standardized protocol, the AI reads these schemas on connect and knows how to call every tool without any prompt engineering. You don't need to teach Claude what `scan_domain` does — it reads the description.

## Real workflow examples

<details>
<summary><strong>1. AI writes an endpoint, you ask "is this safe?"</strong></summary>

```
You: I just wrote /api/users?id=... in Express. Is it safe?

Claude Code: Let me check what Jikida would catch.

  → Called scan_domain({ url: "https://staging.myapp.com/api/users?id=1" })
  ← Grade B. HSTS missing. No exposed .env. SQL-injection surface not
     directly testable without live payload — the WAF would catch a UNION
     SELECT via the sqli.union rule but your app doesn't validate `id`
     as a number, so a live attacker could still enumerate rows.

  → Called list_recent_attacks({ hours: 24 })
  ← 47 SQL-injection attempts blocked on your other sites in the last 24h.
     Common pattern: 1' OR '1'='1

Recommendation: add strict validation `id: z.number().int().positive()`
before the query. Managed WAF already blocks the common `UNION SELECT` /
`OR 1=1` payloads; add custom rules from your dashboard if you need more.
Want me to add the validation?
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>2. Guarding a fix before you ship it</strong></summary>

```
You: I just wrote this login handler — check it before I commit.

Claude Code:
  → Called guard_code({
      language: "js",
      code: "const q = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE email='${email}'`; ..."
    })
  ← 2 findings:
     • HIGH  sql-concat — user input interpolated into a SQL string.
       Use a parameterized query instead.
     • MED   no-rate-limit — auth handler has no per-IP throttle.

Fix the SQL concat with a prepared statement and I'll add a rate limiter
before you commit. Want me to apply both?
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3. Post-mortem on a WAF verdict</strong></summary>

```
You: A user complained their request got blocked. What happened?

Claude Code:
  → Called list_recent_attacks({ hours: 2 })
  ← 1 result: verdict=block, rule=xss.script_tag,
     url=/api/comments?body=<script>alert(1)</script>,
     ip=203.0.113.45, ua=Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh...)

  → Called explain_verdict({ verdict_id: "xss.script_tag" })
  ← This rule blocks any request whose body or query contains a literal
     `<script>` tag. Common false-positive: a developer testing XSS payloads
     against their own site. The rule's target is `body|query` and it
     doesn't inspect the Accept header, so JSON POSTs with escaped
     `<script>` strings (e.g. `"body": "<script>"`) will trigger too.

The user was testing an XSS payload against their own comments. Rule
worked correctly. Recommend: they should test against playground.jikida.io
instead, which is designed for this.
```

</details>

## CLI

```bash
jikida link       # connect this device to your Jikida account (browser flow)
jikida whoami     # print the linked account
jikida status     # ping the Jikida edge, confirm the SDK API is reachable
jikida help       # list every command
jikida logout     # remove ~/.jikida/config.json
```

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Does it modify my code?</strong></summary>

No. The MCP server reads your Jikida account and runs scans. Any *code* change is done by your AI assistant, not by the server. The server itself never touches your filesystem beyond `~/.jikida/config.json`.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Does the AI see my attack logs?</strong></summary>

Only when you ask it to (e.g. "check recent attacks"). The AI cannot poll — every call is initiated by your prompt. Log payloads are truncated to safe lengths (URL 500 chars, body 200 chars).
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Does it change anything without asking me?</strong></summary>

No. Only `add_waf_rule`, `block_ip`, and `set_security_preference` write anything — they are marked as "write" tools in the MCP schema, so every MCP-compatible client shows an explicit confirmation dialog before running them. The server also enforces your per-site plan quota and returns a `429` with an `upgrade_url` when a tool is over quota or above your plan tier.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What about rate limits?</strong></summary>

Same as the Jikida API: read tools are capped per-day per IP (resets midnight UTC), write tools plan-gated. `scan_domain` uses a separate MCP-scan quota — metered apart from the dashboard pentest quota because these scans run on your own AI/compute. The monthly quota scales with your plan (Free / Pro / Max).
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I use it without a Jikida account?</strong></summary>

Four tools work with no token at all: `scan_domain` (1 quick scan/day per IP, top findings only), `check_headers`, `guard_code`, and `check_s3_bucket` — each with a reduced per-day guest cap. Everything else requires a token.
